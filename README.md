## Smart Calendar Agent
This project is a calendar assistant designed to simplify event scheduling. It provides a clean web interface where users can input their mail id and describe an event in natural, everyday language. The agent intelligently parses this text to understand the user's intent, extracting key details such as the event title, date, time, and duration. It then automatically creates an event in Google Calendar and sends an invitation to the user's specified email address, streamlining the entire scheduling process from a simple sentence to a calendar entry.

The application is built with a Python and Streamlit frontend, providing a fast and interactive user experience. The backend logic is orchestrated through a no-code workflow on Relay.app, which handles the data processing and integrations. It leverages a powerful AI model from OpenAI (Prompt GPT-4.1) to perform the natural language understanding and data extraction. This workflow seamlessly connects the user's request and creates an event in our calendar and sends an invite to the specified email address by the user. The user can then just click the `Add to Calendar` button to finish creating that event.
